		<div>
		<p>Newlyweds Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon to find they have been invited by Fiona's parents to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage. Shrek refuses to go at first, but Fiona talks him into it, and along with Donkey, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see both their daughter and son-in-law are ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and Harold's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.</p>

		<p>Harold is reprimanded by the Fairy Godmother and her son Prince Charming by reminding him that Charming was to marry Fiona in exchange for his own happy ending. She implores him to find a way of getting rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which is actually a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, Puss in Boots. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fiona's love for him.</p>

	<div class="content">
		<p>The film's soundtrack features the song "Accidentally in Love" by Counting Crows, which the band's singer and songwriter Adam Duritz believes "fits into the movie because it's the story of people who fall in love who weren't supposed to fall in love." The soundtrack was composed by Harry Gregson Williams.</p>

		<p>Shrek 2: Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack for the hit animated comedy film Shrek 2 and was released in May 2004, to accompany the release of the film. The soundtrack reached the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the Soundtrack Albums as well as topping the albums chart in Australia. The lead single, "Accidentally in Love" by the Counting Crows, reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Adult Top 40, the Top 20 of singles charts worldwide and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. The soundtrack also features two versions of the 1980s Bonnie Tyler hit "Holding Out for a Hero".</p>
