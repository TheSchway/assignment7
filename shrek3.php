	<h2>Plot</h2>

		<p>Shrek and Princess Fiona are to succeed the dying King Harold. Shrek's attempts to serve as the Regent during the King's medical leave end in disaster; Shrek insists that an ogre as king is a bad idea and that there must be someone else to rule the kingdom. Before he dies, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew, Arthur "Artie" Pendragon. Meanwhile, Prince Charming vows to himself that he will become King of Far Far Away and avenge the death of his mother, the Fairy Godmother. Charming goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades fairy tale villains to fight for their "happily ever after".</p>

		<p>Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots set out to retrieve Artie; as they are sailing away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shrek's horror, as he believes he is not capable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny 16-year-old underachiever. At the school pep rally, Shrek tells Artie he will be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the responsibilities of being king. Artie tries taking control of the ship to go back to Worcestershire and as he and Shrek fight over the wheel, it breaks and the ship crashes on a remote island, where they encounter Artie's retired wizard teacher, Merlin.</p>

		<p>Captain Hook and his pirates track Shrek and his friends to Merlin's island, where they attempt to capture Shrek. Shrek and Artie defeat the villains, and Hook mentions Charming and the takeover of Far Far Away. Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire. Instead, Artie cons Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away. The spell causes Puss and Donkey to accidentally switch bodies. They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play. Charming's men arrive, but Artie tricks the knights into not taking them into custody and they break into the castle during rehearsals for the play. Caught in Charming's dressing room, the four are taken captive.</p>

		<p>Charming stages a musical in front of the kingdom. Just as Charming is about to kill Shrek, Fiona, along with Puss, Donkey, the princesses and the fairy tale characters confront the villains. They lose, and Fiona is tied up. Artie shows up and convinces the villains that just because they are being treated like losers does not mean they must be losers. The villains agree to give up their evil ways. Charming refuses to listen, and lunges at Artie with his sword, but Shrek blocks the blow, so Charming attacks him instead. As Shrek pushes Charming aside, Dragon knocks over Rapunzel's tower, seemingly crushing him to death.</p>
