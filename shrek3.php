	<div class="content">
		<p>Shrek and Princess Fiona are to succeed the dying King Harold. Shrek's attempts to serve as the Regent during the King's medical leave end in disaster; Shrek insists that an ogre as king is a bad idea and that there must be someone else to rule the kingdom. Before he dies, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew, Arthur "Artie" Pendragon. Meanwhile, Prince Charming vows to himself that he will become King of Far Far Away and avenge the death of his mother, the Fairy Godmother. Charming goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades fairy tale villains to fight for their "happily ever after".</p>

		<p>Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots set out to retrieve Artie; as they are sailing away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shrek's horror, as he believes he is not capable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny 16-year-old underachiever. At the school pep rally, Shrek tells Artie he will be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the responsibilities of being king. Artie tries taking control of the ship to go back to Worcestershire and as he and Shrek fight over the wheel, it breaks and the ship crashes on a remote island, where they encounter Artie's retired wizard teacher, Merlin.</p>
